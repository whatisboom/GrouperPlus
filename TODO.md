### Role Management
- [ ] Add role limits per group (1 tank, 1 healer, 3 DPS per group)
- [ ] Configurable role caps in options panel

### Display Control
- [ ] Control player position/ordering within dynamic group display
- [ ] Role-based positioning (tanks first, healers, then DPS)

### Group Utility Tracking
- [ ] Track group buffs and utilities (bloodlust, battle rez, powerful abilities)
- [ ] Display utility coverage per group
- [ ] Consider utility distribution when forming groups

### Automatic Group Formation
- [ ] Auto-form groups based on mythic plus rating
- [ ] Respect role limits (1 tank, 1 healer, 3 DPS) when auto-forming
- [ ] Balance groups by skill level/rating

### Inter-Addon Communication
- [ ] Implement addon communication protocol for data sharing
- [ ] Sync group formations between users with the addon installed
- [ ] Share player data and group assignments across addon users
- [ ] Share RaiderIO information so only one person needs both addons installed
